# School_District_Analysis
**Overview of the school district analysis**

In general, analysis is refining data into a format that is easier to comprehend. It provides clarity and simplification to quickly interpret the meaning and potential use it to impact other data. Specifically for this project, I was able to analyze school district data that included multiple schools, types of schools, student names, student IDs, and math and reading scores to present to a school board. The school board can use this data to make informed and data-driven decisions to support all stakeholders within the school district. 
 
**Results**

With the removal of the Thomas High School 9th Grade math and reading scores, it negatively affected Thomas High School's overall data. It also negatively affected the district data. It is important to note that any time significant data must be excluded from the overall analysis, the outcome or output will be skewed.
